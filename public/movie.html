<h3>1. SpiderMan - into the spiderverse</h3>
<p>This is the movie I was once forced to watch but ended up loving it. <br />
   The amazing animations, the sound, the mosic, the story. Everything is just so so good that i couldnt get over it.

<h3>2. Elements</h3>
<p>I always watch animated movies, so this movie was one of them which i absolutely liked how the story began and ended beautifully</p>

<h3>3. Jigra</h3>
<p>I watched this in theaters. Strting from the directions of the movies till the climax was just so good. <br />
   I love it's title song which is "Tenu sang rakhna".
